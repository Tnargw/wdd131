			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>        
                The purpose of this site is to showcase my programming projects,
                skills, and background to potential employers and peers in a
                visually appealing and professional way.
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                The intended audience includes anyone interested in my programming work, but 
                especially employers, peers, and anyone curious about the kind of projects 
                I have built and the technologies I am familiar with.
            </p>
            

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
            <p>
                JavaScript will be used to add interactive features including a light/dark mode 
                toggle, and a search option that allows users to search for a project by name or
                by project tags.
              </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/0d1b2a-2c3e60-415a77-778da9-e0e1dd"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/0d1b2a-2c3e60-415a77-778da9-e0e1dd</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#2C3E60]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#778DA9]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#415A77]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#E0E1DD]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Montserrat
			</h4>
            <p>
                Montserrat was chosen for headings because it is modern, clean, and professional. 
                It stands out well at larger sizes, which makes it good for titles and section 
                headers.
              </p>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Open Sans
			</h4>
            <p>
                Open Sans was selected for the body text because it is very readable at smaller 
                sizes and looks great on screens. It pairs well with Montserrat, and offers a 
                clean and minimal style that doesn't distract from the main content.
              </p>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>

				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>
                The home page will introduce visitors to my portfolio with a short welcome 
                message and a preview of who I am. It will primarily focus on showcasing my 
                programming projects. Each project will have a title, image, short description, 
                and tags for the language used, project type, ETC. You will be able to filter 
                projects by category using JavaScript. The page will also include a light/dark 
                theme toggle button.
            </p>
			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>  
                The about page will share more about me as a person and a developer. 
                It will include some personal information, a photo, and some background on 
                how I got into programming. I will describe my skills, education, and goals. 
                This page will help visitors understand my personality, interests, and why 
                I love programming.
            </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
            <p>
                The home page will include a brief welcome message near the top to introduce 
                people to the site. Below that, the main content will be a grid layout of 
                project cards that show my web development work. Each card will include a project 
                title, image, short description, and have tags. There will also be a search 
                option to search for projects by name or tags using JavaScript.
              </p>
